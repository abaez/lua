Review of Lua
=============
A set of reviews on the lua programming language
------------------------------------------------

### orig
The work done here was when I first learned the language. I used the [WROX: Beginning Lua Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Lua-Programming-Kurt-Jung/dp/0470069171/ref=tmm_pap_title_0) to get started.

### review
This holds both the work I done in review with [PIL 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/859037985X/lua-pilindex-20) and other random things I found to want to check over for Lua.
